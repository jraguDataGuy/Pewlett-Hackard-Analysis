# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett Hackard is quickly approaching a mass retirement of current employees. Our folks internally have dubbed this a "silver tsunmai" given the large number of employees we expect to see leave in the next year. Our goal was to find job titles in which we needed to address sooner rather than later, while identifying a group of employees.
## Results
* We have identified vacancies by job title.
  - 25,916 Senior Engineers
  - 24,926 Senior Staff
  - 9,285 Engineers
  - 7,636 Staff
  - 3,603 Technique Leaders
  - 1,090 Assistant Engineers
  - 2 Managers
* In our next analysis, we looked for the number of employees we can look to get into mentorship tracks as soon as possible
* We used 1965 as the birth year to identify more senior members of the staff
* Of our mentorship list, we have the following immediate candidates 10 years from retirement:
  - 419 Staff
  - 409 Senior Engineers
  - 305 Senior Staff
  - 294 Engineers
  - 77 Technique Leaders
  - 45 Assitant Engineers
## Summary
Ultimately, we have 72,458 employees approaching retirement. We do not have enough mentors to fill this void. We will need to start identifying a few more groups to fill the coming need. This might include longest tenored staff or exploring outside recruting firms to fill where we fall short.
